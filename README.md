**2/28/20 Update: AddonDocs is in Maintenace Mode.**

AddonDocs is still actively being used by many addons, but is effectively in maintenance mode as the original authors are no longer working on this project.

So, there's lots of good stuff in here, but use it at your own risk!

If you run into parts of the guides that are confusing or out-of-date, check the issues/PRs, or hop into the #ec-addon-docs channel in Discord.
