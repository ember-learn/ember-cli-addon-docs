The original maintainers of AddonDocs have moved on, but this addon is still very much actively maintained and is still being used by many addons.
We are currently working on embroider and fastboot support, and would love help, if anyone would like to help out!

If you run into parts of the guides that are confusing or out-of-date, check the issues/PRs, or hop into the #ec-addon-docs channel in Discord.
