# Usage

## Requirements

To use AddonDocs, your addon must have a `devDependency` of **Ember v2.8** or higher.

Note that your addon can still support older versions of Ember – it's just that you won't be able to run your AddonDocs documentation site against those older versions. (This means you also cannot write acceptance/application tests against your docs sites on older versions of Ember.)


## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-cli-addon-docs
```

## Visual Studio Code integration

To get AddonDocs autocomplete in your projects, install [els-addon-docs](https://github.com/lifeart/els-addon-docs) for [Unstable Ember Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable) as a `devDependency` for your project.
