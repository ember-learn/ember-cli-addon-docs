# Docs Logo

An SVG logo that fills its container and takes on the current color.

By default it renders the Ember logo (you can also pass `@logo="ember"`):

{{docs/components/docs-logo/demo1}}

Pass `@logo="ember-cli"` for the Ember CLI logo:

{{docs/components/docs-logo/demo2}}

Pass `@logo="ember-data"` for the Ember Data logo:

{{docs/components/docs-logo/demo3}}
